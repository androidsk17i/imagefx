## How It Works

The ImageFX Description Generator builds structured descriptions using these elements:

1. **Photography Style** - Professional photography style (60+ options)
2. **Setting** - Environment or background (60+ options)
3. **Subject Description** - Enhanced with ethnicity and physique details
4. **Lighting** - Professional lighting setup (60+ options)
5. **Atmosphere** - Mood and feel (60+ options)
6. **Camera & Lens** - Professional equipment details (60+ options each)
7. **Technical Settings** - Composition and technical specifics (60+ options)
8. **Resolution** - Quality and resolution details (60+ options)
9. **Aesthetic** - Overall visual style (60+ options)
10. **Quality Descriptors** - Professional finishing touches (60+ options)

Each generation randomizes not just the elements, but also their inclusion probability, order, and phrasing for truly unique outputs every time.
